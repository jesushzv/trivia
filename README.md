# Trivia
This is a personal project that I built to learn React.

## Description
I used React to build this project
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)
The questions and answers of the trivia are from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com)
The Database is supported by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

## Usage
Enter your username and start playing!
You will get a question and four possible answers.
Pick one. 
If you're successfull you'll continue playing.
If you're not, you'll see what was the correct answer and a leaderboard with the highest scores.

## Roadmap
- I've been able to fix most of the character entities, but surely there will be more in the future
- I'd like to add a 3 lifes mode as the scores are usually fairly low
